# Wiki spike CSS

The simplest thing that could possibly work to make federated wiki work better
on mobile devices. Also an invitation for folks to experiment with CSS. Also
anticipate playing with javascript to remove the dependency on old jQuery UI.

* saved a wide lineup from my wiki using Firefox's save web page complete.
  This lineup in particular: http://wiki.dbbs.co/view/recent-changes/view/massive-obsidian-mermaid/view/experimental-wiki-clipboard/view/loosely-coupled-teams
* threw away all the existing CSS and javascript.
* created as little CSS as possible to try to re-create the wiki lineup.
* I also replaced the youtube iframe with a screenshot.
